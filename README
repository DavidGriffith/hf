This is the first public release of my HF amateur protocol suite for Linux
using a soundcard as a modem. The state of the software is early alpha.
Although the protocols RTTY, Amtor (Sitor) and Pactor 1 are almost
fully implemented, it might not yet be completely stable, and there might
be interface changes in the future.


THE CONCEPT

The implementation of the protocol uses one binary called hfkernel, which
has no user interface. hfkernel provides an UNIX domain socket to
communicate with the user interface or mailbox or whatever. UNIX
domain sockets were chosen since they could be easily changed to
internet domain sockets in the future, to let the hfkernel process
run on a different machine than the user interface.

hfkernel internally uses three threads, one for the L1 FSK modem code,
one for the protocol, and one that handles socket I/O.


THE USER INTERFACE

A terminal program is included. This is however only "an excuse for
a terminal program". I'll leave it to someone else to write something
decent.


THE INSTALLATION

Since the hfkernel software uses many advanced operating system features,
some of them only available under Linux, there isn't anything to configure.
Run make to compile the software.

It is very important you calibrate your clock source as described in
doc/hfkernel.1 (groff -Tascii -mandoc doc/hfkernel.1 |less)

To run it, first run hfkernel as root, then start hfterm as ordinary
user. Don't forget to supply the correction factors on the hfkernel
command line. If you terminate hfterm, you might currently also have to
terminate and restart hfkernel.
